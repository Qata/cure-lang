# AUTOPILOT STATE — Macro Facility Build (base + self-proving extension)

**Started:** 2026-07-12. **Branch:** `core-let-binder` (staying in the accumulating
stack — the macro work builds on the landed Effect/graded-binder/Std.Otp stack here;
deliberate deviation from autopilot's nested-worktree default, per
autopilot-worktree-preference). Cron-driven; this file is the durable resume point.

## Stage 0 — DONE (design approved, specs committed)
- Self-proving design APPROVED by operator; specs committed:
  - `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-11-self-proving-macros-design.md` (extension)
  - `docs/superpowers/specs/macros/2026-07-08-macro-facility-design.md` (base)
  - `docs/superpowers/specs/macros/2026-07-12-racket-syntax-parse-comparison.md`
  - `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-12-macro-facility-program.md` (SP decomposition)
  - `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-12-macro-facility-sp1-grounding.md` (parser map + architecture)

## The program: 6 sub-projects (run the autopilot chain per SP, in order)
SP1 minimal facility (container+grammar+Tiers1-2) → SP2 Tier3+typed errors+examples →
SP3 generative expansion proof → SP4 reflection API → SP5 behaviour/lift-module (Std.Otp
ceiling) → SP6 Tier5+DSLs. SP1→SP2 spine; SP3/4/5 fan out from SP2.

## Autopilot chain PER sub-project
Stage 2 write the SP plan (writing-plans) → Stage 3 plan review (Sonnet subagent,
recursive-skeptical-review) → Stage 4 TDD execute (Opus) → Stage 5 code review (Sonnet
subagent) → Stage 6 verify (full suite). Commit per stage/task. Stage 1 spec review is
DONE for the shared specs (self-reviewed); each SP plan still gets Stage 3.

## Locked decisions carried into every SP
- **TCB delta ZERO** — macro output is re-elaborated + kernel-checked; NO `lib/cure/core/*`
  changes. Any SP that thinks it needs one is mis-scoped → HALT.
- **User-facing syntax DEFERRED** (operator: easiest to change) — use the design's current
  notation as a placeholder; do not block on surface spelling.
- **Port syntax-parse's machinery** for error quality (comparison doc §4): failure-SET →
  maximal-by-progress → report(message,context,at,within). **Thread progress from SP1
  task 1** (retrofitting it later is painful).
- Self-proving obligations: SP2 (typed exhaustive Diagnosis incl. `fail C`, required
  examples) + SP3 (full generative expansion fuzz on every macro compile).
- Two-phase parse (pre-pass seeds `active_macros` from `use`+local defs) = SP1's
  architectural core (grounding doc). Soft-keyword `macro`; `{:macro_def,meta,rules}` AST.

## CURRENT POSITION
SP1, Stage 2 (write SP1's task-by-task plan). Prereq before complete-code tasks: read the
exact parser anchors — `parse_fsm/1` (parser.ex:3894) + block helpers + peek/advance/
expect/Token API; lexer `@keywords`/`lex_identifier`/`lex_decimal`. Then write
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-12-macro-facility-sp1-plan.md` (two-phase parse +
progress-threading from task 1).

## DONE criterion (cancel cron + notify)
All 6 sub-projects implemented, code-reviewed, full `mix test` green, with an end-to-end
proof: a user-defined macro parses, expands, is generatively proven to expand to
well-typed Core, and its expansion runs. Then CronDelete + PushNotification.

## HALT protocol
Hard blocker or a review loop hitting pass 15 without convergence → update THIS file with
the blocker + what's needed, PushNotification, STOP. Never guess or accept an unconverged
artifact.
