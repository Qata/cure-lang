# AUTOPILOT STATE — Macro Facility Build (base + self-proving extension)

**Started:** 2026-07-12. **Branch:** `core-let-binder` (staying in the accumulating
stack — the macro work builds on the landed Effect/graded-binder/Std.Otp stack here;
deliberate deviation from autopilot's nested-worktree default, per
autopilot-worktree-preference). Cron-driven; this file is the durable resume point.

## Stage 0 — DONE (design approved, specs committed)
- Self-proving design APPROVED by operator; specs committed:
  - `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-11-self-proving-macros-design.md` (extension)
  - `docs/superpowers/specs/macros/2026-07-08-macro-facility-design.md` (base)
  - `docs/superpowers/specs/macros/2026-07-12-racket-syntax-parse-comparison.md`
  - `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-12-macro-facility-program.md` (SP decomposition)
  - `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-12-macro-facility-sp1-grounding.md` (parser map + architecture)

## The program: 6 sub-projects (run the autopilot chain per SP, in order)
SP1 minimal facility (container+grammar+Tiers1-2) → SP2 Tier3+typed errors+examples →
SP3 generative expansion proof → SP4 reflection API → SP5 behaviour/lift-module (Std.Otp
ceiling) → SP6 Tier5+DSLs. SP1→SP2 spine; SP3/4/5 fan out from SP2.

## Autopilot chain PER sub-project
Stage 2 write the SP plan (writing-plans) → Stage 3 plan review (Sonnet subagent,
recursive-skeptical-review) → Stage 4 TDD execute (Opus) → Stage 5 code review (Sonnet
subagent) → Stage 6 verify (full suite). Commit per stage/task. Stage 1 spec review is
DONE for the shared specs (self-reviewed); each SP plan still gets Stage 3.

## Locked decisions carried into every SP
- **TCB delta ZERO** — macro output is re-elaborated + kernel-checked; NO `lib/cure/core/*`
  changes. Any SP that thinks it needs one is mis-scoped → HALT.
- **User-facing syntax DEFERRED** (operator: easiest to change) — use the design's current
  notation as a placeholder; do not block on surface spelling.
- **Port syntax-parse's machinery** for error quality (comparison doc §4): failure-SET →
  maximal-by-progress → report(message,context,at,within). **Thread progress from SP1
  task 1** (retrofitting it later is painful).
- Self-proving obligations: SP2 (typed exhaustive Diagnosis incl. `fail C`, required
  examples) + SP3 (full generative expansion fuzz on every macro compile).
- Two-phase parse (pre-pass seeds `active_macros` from `use`+local defs) = SP1's
  architectural core (grounding doc). Soft-keyword `macro`; `{:macro_def,meta,rules}` AST.

## CURRENT POSITION
SP1, Stage 2 DONE for milestone 1 (macro-definition front-end): plan committed at
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-12-macro-facility-sp1-plan.md` (`6f76a94`), tasks 1-3
with complete anchored code (soft-keyword `macro`, `syntax` rules, typed holes →
`{:macro_def, meta, rules}` progress-slotted AST). Parser anchors verified & recorded in
the plan's Global Constraints (Token/state/helpers, soft-keyword dispatch at
parser.ex:292-340, parse_fsm template at :3894).

Stage 3 DONE — plan hardened + committed `6dedd96` (4 passes, 2 clean). Reviewer caught
& fixed two CRITICAL defects and VERIFIED the corrected code for real (scratch-applied,
6/6 new tests pass, `test/cure/compiler/` suite = 625 passed, then reverted):
- `Parser.parse/2` returns the BARE node, never a list → tests use `node = parse!(...)`.
- `end` is a reserved keyword no container consumes; Cure containers close by DEDENT →
  the macro sources have NO trailing `end` (`macro Every\n`, not `macro Every\nend\n`).
- Token atoms `:lt`/`:gt`/`:colon` confirmed correct; all anchors verified exact.
Use the HARDENED plan (`6dedd96`) for execution — it is proven to work.

**NEXT:** Stage 4 — execute tasks 1-3 inline TDD on **Opus**, commit per task, scoped
`mix test test/cure/compiler/macro_def_parse_test.exs` then `test/cure/compiler/`. The
reviewer already proved the code green, so expect smooth TDD; still follow red→green per
step. THEN Stage 5 code review (Sonnet) over the diff → Stage 6 verify. THEN the next
Stage-2 increment: SP1 tasks T4 (literal/suffix lexer) → T5 two-phase parse → T6 use-site
matching (thread progress; port syntax-parse maximal-by-progress) → T7 hygienic expansion
→ T8 kernel re-check → T9 scoping. When SP1 is fully executed + code-reviewed +
suite-green, update this file and start SP2.

## DONE criterion (cancel cron + notify)
All 6 sub-projects implemented, code-reviewed, full `mix test` green, with an end-to-end
proof: a user-defined macro parses, expands, is generatively proven to expand to
well-typed Core, and its expansion runs. Then CronDelete + PushNotification.

## HALT protocol
Hard blocker or a review loop hitting pass 15 without convergence → update THIS file with
the blocker + what's needed, PushNotification, STOP. Never guess or accept an unconverged
artifact.
